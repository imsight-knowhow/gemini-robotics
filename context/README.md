# Context Directory

This directory serves as a centralized knowledge base for AI assistants working on the Gemini Robotics Technology Survey project.

## Purpose

The `context/` directory organizes research findings, development plans, and knowledge artifacts related to understanding Google's Gemini Robotics technologies. This structure helps maintain continuity across research sessions and provides a comprehensive view of the project's evolution.

## Directory Structure

- **design/**: Technical specifications, architecture diagrams, and system designs for Gemini Robotics components
- **hints/**: Development guides, research methodologies, and troubleshooting tips for robotics AI exploration
- **logs/**: Research session records, findings, and outcomes from investigation activities
- **plans/**: Implementation roadmaps, research strategies, and project milestones
- **refcode/**: Reference implementations, code examples, and integration patterns from Gemini Robotics
- **summaries/**: Knowledge base documents, concept explanations, and research syntheses
- **tasks/**: Current and planned research work items, including literature reviews and technical explorations
- **tools/**: Development utilities, scripts, and resources for analyzing robotics AI concepts

## Usage Guidelines

1. Each directory contains a README.md explaining its specific purpose
2. Documents should include metadata headers with creation date, author, and status
3. Use descriptive filenames with appropriate prefixes (dates for logs, action verbs for hints)
4. Keep content current and reference this structure in main project documentation
5. Cross-reference related materials across directories

## Project Focus Areas

This context directory specifically supports research into:
- Embodied reasoning models (Gemini Robotics-ER)
- On-device AI capabilities (Gemini Robotics On-Device)
- Developer tools and SDKs for robotics applications
- Complex task learning for robotic systems
- Safety considerations in AI-powered robotics

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance includes updating task lists, archiving completed research, and documenting new findings as they emerge.
