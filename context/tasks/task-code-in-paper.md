the paper provides a link: `https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Spatial_understanding_3d.ipynb`, the code is already downloaded here `context\refcode\spatial_understanding_3d.py`, with the following content in paper:

```text
Below we present detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations of these capabilities with Gemini 2.0 models (Flash, and Pro Experimental), as well as comparisons with other VLMs where appropriate. For some capabilities, we also present results on Gemini Robotics-ER. You can find code and prompt examples on how to prompt Gemini 2.0 to elicit these capabilities here
```

find out what that code does, and answer the following questions:

- what does the code do, the process and results?
- does the code provide any public access to the Gemini Robotics-ER model?
