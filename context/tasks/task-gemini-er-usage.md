read the paper `analysis\paper-source\paper\gemini-robotics-paper-arxiv.md` , and answer me
- in section 2, it introduces gemini robotics ER model:
- - is this model available for online public testing?
- - what it takes to train this model?
- - are there any other public models that can work this way?
