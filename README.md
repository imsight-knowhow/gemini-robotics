# Gemini Robotics Technology Survey

This is a learning project dedicated to surveying the technologies related to Google's Gemini Robotics. The goal of this project is to gather and understand the key concepts, models, and software development kits (SDKs) that are part of this initiative to bring advanced AI into the physical world.

## About Gemini Robotics

As introduced by Google DeepMind, Gemini Robotics is a new generation of AI models designed to power more helpful and capable robots. This initiative builds upon the foundations of the Gemini models, adapting them for embodied AI tasks.

Key aspects of Gemini Robotics include:

*   **Embodied Reasoning:** Models like **Gemini Robotics-ER** are designed for tasks that require understanding and interacting with the physical world. This includes object detection, pointing to specific parts of objects, and understanding 3D space.
*   **On-Device AI:** With **Gemini Robotics On-Device**, powerful Visual Language Action (VLA) models are optimized to run locally on robotic hardware. This allows for faster reaction times and operation without a constant cloud connection.
*   **Developer Tools:** A **Gemini Robotics SDK** is provided to help developers evaluate and adapt these models for their own robotics tasks and environments, even with a small amount of demonstration data.
*   **Complex Task Learning:** The models enable robots to learn and perform complex, multi-step tasks such as preparing food, playing games, and even delicate operations like folding origami.
*   **Safety:** A core component of Gemini Robotics is a focus on safety, enabling the models to understand and avoid unsafe actions in a given context.

This project will explore these areas and more, documenting findings and creating a knowledge base for anyone interested in the future of AI-powered robotics.
