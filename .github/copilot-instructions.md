# Rules for this Project

## Terminology
- `ER`: Embodied Reasoning, the chains of thought capability of VLM(Vision-Language Models) or VLA(Vision-Language Action) models.
- `VLA`: Vision-Language Action, a type of model that can understand and generate actions based on visual and language inputs.
- `VLM`: Vision-Language Model, a model that can process and understand both visual and language inputs.
- `ER Model`: A model that incorporates Embodied Reasoning capabilities, allowing it to perform complex reasoning tasks based on visual and language inputs, in this project, it specifically refers to the `Gemini Robotics-ER` model, given in `source-paper`.
