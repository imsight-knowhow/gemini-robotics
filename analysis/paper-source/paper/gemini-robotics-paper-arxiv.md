## Abstract

Recent advancements in large multimodal models have led to the emergence of remarkable generalist capabilities in digital domains, yet their translation to physical agents such as robots remains a significant challenge. Generally useful robots need to be able to make sense of the physical world around them, and interact with it competently and safely. This report introduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks like folding an origami fox or playing a game of cards, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations, adapting to completely novel robot embodiments including a bi-arm platform and a high degrees-of-freedom humanoid. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work.

Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Gemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as 3D understanding in the form of multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of robotics applications, e.g., zero-shot (via robot code generation), or few-shot (via in-context learning). We also discuss and address important safety considerations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The Gemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing general-purpose robots that realize AI's potential in the physical world.

## 1 Introduction

The remarkable progress of modern artificial intelligence (AI) models – with pre-training on large-scale datasets – has redefined information processing, demonstrating proficiency and generalization across diverse modalities such as text, images, audio, and video. This has opened a vast landscape of opportunities for interactive and assistive systems within the digital realm, ranging from multimodal chatbots to virtual assistants. However, realizing the potential of general-purpose autonomous AI in the physical world requires a substantial shift from the digital world, where physically grounded AI agents must demonstrate robust human-level embodied reasoning: The set of world knowledge that encompasses the fundamental concepts which are critical for operating and acting in an inherently physically embodied world.

While, as humans, we take for granted our embodied reasoning abilities – such as perceiving the 3D structure of environments, interpreting complex inter-object relationships, or understanding intuitive physics – these capabilities form an important basis for any embodied AI agent. Furthermore, an embodied AI agent must also go beyond passively understanding the spatial and physical concepts of the real world; it must also learn to take actions that have direct effects on their external environment, bridging the gap between passive perception and active physical interaction.

With the recent advancements in robotics hardware, there is exciting potential for creating embodied AI agents that can perform highly dexterous tasks. With this in mind, we ask: What would it take to endow a state-of-the-art digital AI model with the embodied reasoning capabilities needed to interact with our world in a general and dexterous manner?

Our thesis is predicated on harnessing the advanced multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities inherent in frontier Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Gemini 2.0. The generalized comprehension afforded by these foundation models, with their ability to interpret visual inputs and complex text instructions, forms a powerful foundation for building embodied agents. This endeavor hinges on two fundamental components. First, Gemini needs to acquire robust embodied reasoning, gaining the ability to understand the rich geometric and temporal-spatial details of the physical world. Second, we must ground this embodied reasoning in the physical world by enabling Gemini to speak the language of physical actions, understanding contact physics, dynamics, and the intricacies of real-world interactions. Ultimately, these pieces must coalesce to enable fast, safe and dexterous control of robots in the real world.

To this end, we introduce the Gemini Robotics family of embodied AI models, built on top of Gemini 2.0, our most advanced multimodal foundation model. We first validate the performance and generality of the base Gemini 2.0's innate embodied reasoning capabilities with a new open-source general embodied reasoning benchmark, ERQA. We then introduce two models:

The first model is **Gemini Robotics-ER**, a VLM with strong embodied reasoning capabilities at its core, exhibiting generalization across a wide range of embodied reasoning tasks while also maintaining its core foundation model capabilities. Gemini Robotics-ER exhibits strong performance on multiple capabilities critical for understanding the physical world, ranging from 3D perception to detailed pointing to robot state estimation and affordance prediction via code.

The second model is **Gemini Robotics**, a state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that connects strong embodied reasoning priors to dexterous low-level control of real-world robots to solve challenging manipulation tasks. As a generalist VLA, Gemini Robotics can perform a wide array of diverse and complicated tasks, while also closely following language guidance and generalizing to distribution shifts in instructions, visuals, and motions.

To emphasize the flexibility and generality of the Gemini Robotics models, we also introduce an optional specialization stage, which demonstrates how Gemini Robotics can be adapted for extreme dexterity, for advanced reasoning in difficult generalization settings, and for controlling completely new robot embodiments.

Finally, we discuss the safety implications of training large robotics models such as the Gemini Robotics models, and provide guidelines for how to study such challenges in the context of VLAs.

Specifically, this report highlights:

1. **ERQA**: An open-source benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied reasoning capabilities of multimodal models, addressing the lack of benchmarks that go beyond assessing atomic capabilities and facilitating standardized assessment and future research.

2. **Gemini Robotics-ER**: A VLM demonstrating enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities.

3. **Gemini Robotics**: A VLA model resulting from the integration of robot action data, enabling high-frequency dexterous control, robust generalization and fast adaptation across diverse robotic tasks and embodiments.

4. **Responsible Development**: We discuss and exercise responsible development of our family of models in alignment with Google AI Principles carefully studying the societal benefits and risks of our models, and potential risk mitigation.

The Gemini Robotics models serve as an initial step towards more generally capable robots. We believe that, ultimately, harnessing the embodied reasoning capabilities from internet scale data, grounded with action data from real world interactions, can enable robots to deeply understand the physical world and act competently. This understanding will empower them to achieve even the most challenging goals with generality and sophistication that has so far seemed out of reach for robotic systems.

## 2 Embodied Reasoning with Gemini 2.0

Gemini 2.0 is a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that is capable of going beyond tasks that only require visual understanding and language processing. In particular, this model exhibits advanced *embodied reasoning* (ER) capabilities. We define ER as the ability of a Vision-Language Model to ground objects and spatial concepts in the real world, and the ability to synthesize those signals for downstream robotics applications.

In Section 2.1, we first introduce a benchmark for evaluating a broad spectrum of ER capabilities and show that Gemini 2.0 models are state-of-the-art. In Section 2.2, we demonstrate the wide range of specific ER capabilities enabled by Gemini 2.0. Finally, in Section 2.3, we showcase how these capabilities can be put to use in robotics applications without the need for fine-tuning on robot action data, enabling use cases such as zero-shot control via code generation and few-shot robot control via in-context learning.

### 2.1 Embodied Reasoning Question Answering (ERQA) Benchmark

To capture progress in embodied reasoning for VLMs, we introduce ERQA, short for Embodied Reasoning Question Answering, a benchmark that focuses specifically on capabilities likely required by an embodied agent interacting with the physical world. ERQA consists of 400 multiple choice Visual Question Answering (VQA)-style questions across a wide variety of categories, including spatial reasoning, trajectory reasoning, action reasoning, state estimation, pointing, multi-view reasoning, and task reasoning.

Of the 400 questions 28% have more than one image in the prompt — these questions that require corresponding concepts across multiple images tend to be more challenging than single-image questions.

ERQA is complementary to existing VLM benchmarks, which tend to highlight more atomic capabilities (e.g., object recognition, counting, localization), but in most cases do not take sufficient account of the broader set of capabilities needed to act in the physical world. Some questions require the VLM to recognize and register objects across multiple frames; others require reasoning about objects' affordances and 3D relationships with the rest of the scene.

Full details of the benchmark can be found at https://github.com/embodiedreasoning/ERQA.

We manually labeled all questions in ERQA to ensure correctness and quality. Images (not questions) in the benchmark are either taken by ourselves or sourced from these datasets: OXE, UMI Data, MECCANO, HoloAssist, and EGTEA Gaze+.

**ERQA Results:**

| Benchmark | Gemini 1.5 Flash | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental | GPT 4o-mini | GPT 4o | Claude 3.5 Sonnet |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------------------|
| ERQA | 42.3 | 41.8 | 46.3 | 48.3 | 37.3 | 47.0 | 35.5 |
| RealworldQA (test) | 69.0 | 64.5 | 71.6 | 74.5 | 65.0 | 71.9 | 61.4 |
| BLINK (val) | 59.2 | 64.4 | 65.0 | 65.2 | 56.9 | 62.3 | 60.2 |

Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro Experimental achieve a new state-of-the-art on all three benchmarks in their respective model classes. We also note that ERQA is the most challenging benchmark across these three, making the performance here especially notable.

**Chain-of-Thought Performance:**

| Prompt Variant | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental | GPT 4o-mini | GPT 4o | Claude 3.5 Sonnet |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------------------|
| Without CoT | 46.3 | 48.3 | 37.3 | 47.0 | 35.5 |
| With CoT | 50.3 | 54.8 | 40.5 | 50.5 | 45.8 |

Gemini 2.0 models are capable of advanced reasoning — we found we can significantly improve Gemini 2.0's performance on the benchmark if we use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which encourages the model to output reasoning traces to "think" about a problem before choosing the multiple choice answer, instead of directly predicting the answer.

### 2.2 Gemini 2.0's Embodied Reasoning Capabilities

In this section, we illustrate some of Gemini 2.0's embodied reasoning capabilities in more detail. We also introduce Gemini Robotics-ER, a version of Gemini 2.0 Flash that has enhanced embodied reasoning. These can be used in robotics applications without the need for any additional robot-specific data or training.

**2D Spatial Understanding:**

Gemini 2.0 can understand a variety of 2D spatial concepts in images:

1. **Object Detection**: Gemini 2.0 can perform open-world 2D object detection, providing precise 2D bounding boxes with queries that can be explicit (e.g., describing an object name) or implicit (categories, attributes, or functions).

2. **Pointing**: Given any natural language description, the model is able to point to explicit entities like objects and object parts, as well as implicit notions such as affordances (where to grasp, where to place), free space and spatial concepts.

3. **Trajectory Prediction**: Gemini 2.0 can leverage its pointing capabilities to produce 2D motion trajectories that are grounded in its observations. Trajectories can be based, for instance, on a description of the physical motion or interaction.

4. **Grasp Prediction**: This is a new feature introduced in Gemini Robotics-ER. It extends Gemini 2.0's pointing capabilities to predict top-down grasps.

**3D Spatial Understanding:**

Gemini 2.0 is also capable of 3D spatial reasoning. With the ability to "see in 3D", Gemini 2.0 can better understand concepts like sizes, distances, and orientations, and it can leverage such understanding to reason about the state of the scene and actions to perform.

1. **Multi-View Correspondence**: A natural way of representing 3D information with images is through multi-view (e.g., stereo) images. Gemini 2.0 can understand 3D scenes from multi-view images and predict 2D point correspondences across multiple camera views of the same scene.

2. **3D Bounding Box Detection**: This 3D understanding applies to single images as well - Gemini 2.0 can directly predict metric 3D bounding boxes from monocular images. Like 2D Detection and Pointing capabilities, Gemini 2.0 can detect objects by open-vocabulary descriptions.

**Quantitative Results:**

**2D Pointing Benchmarks:**

| Benchmark | Gemini Robotics-ER | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental | GPT 4o-mini | GPT 4o | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Molmo 7B-D | Molmo 72B |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Paco-LVIS | 71.3 | 46.1 | 45.5 | 11.8 | 16.2 | 12.4 | 45.4 | 47.1 |
| Pixmo-Point | 49.5 | 25.8 | 20.9 | 5.9 | 5.0 | 7.2 | 14.7 | 12.5 |
| Where2Place | 45.0 | 33.8 | 38.8 | 13.8 | 20.6 | 16.2 | 45 | 63.8 |

Gemini 2.0 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) like GPT and Claude. Gemini Robotics-ER surpasses Molmo, a specialized pointing VLM, in two of the three subtasks.

**3D Object Detection:**

| Benchmark | Gemini Robotics-ER | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental | ImVoxelNet | Implicit3D | Total3DU |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------|------------|----------|
| SUN-RGBD AP@15 | 48.3 | 30.7 | 32.5 | 43.7* | 24.1 | 14.3 |

Gemini Robotics-ER achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the SUN-RGBD 3D object detection benchmark. (* ImVoxelNet performance measured on an easier set of 10 categories).

### 2.3 Gemini 2.0 Enables Zero and Few-Shot Robot Control

Gemini 2.0's embodied reasoning capabilities make it possible to control a robot without it ever having been trained with any robot action data. It can perform all the necessary steps, perception, state estimation, spatial reasoning, planning and control, out of the box. Whereas previous work needed to compose multiple models to this end, Gemini 2.0 unites all required capabilities in a single model.

Below we study two distinct approaches: zero-shot robot control via code generation, and few-shot control via in-context learning (also denoted as "ICL" below) - where we condition the model on a handful of in-context demonstrations for a new behavior. Gemini Robotics-ER achieves good performance across a range of different tasks in both settings, and we find that especially zero-shot robot control performance is strongly correlated with better embodied understanding: Gemini Robotics-ER, which has received more comprehensive training to this end, improves task completion by almost 2x compared to Gemini 2.0.

**Zero-shot Control via Code Generation:**

To test Gemini 2.0's zero-shot control capabilities, we combine its innate ability to generate code with the embodied reasoning capabilities described in Section 2.2. We conduct experiments on a bimanual ALOHA 2 robot. To control the robot, Gemini 2.0 has access to an API that can move each gripper to a specified pose, open and close each gripper, and provide a readout of the current robot state.

**ALOHA 2 Simulation Results:**

| System | Context | Avg. | Banana Lift | Banana in Bowl | Mug on Plate | Bowl on Rack | Banana Handover | Fruit Bowl | Pack Toy |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| 2.0 Flash | Zero-shot | 27 | 34 | 54 | 46 | 24 | 26 | 4 | 0 |
| Gemini Robotics-ER | Zero-shot | 53 | 86 | 84 | 72 | 60 | 54 | 16 | 0 |
| 2.0 Flash | ICL | 51 | 94 | 90 | 36 | 16 | 94 | 0 | 26 |
| Gemini Robotics-ER | ICL | 65 | 96 | 96 | 74 | 36 | 96 | 4 | 54 |

**Real World Results:**

| Context | Avg. | Banana Handover | Fold Dress | Wiping |
|---------|------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| Zero-shot | 25 | 30 | 0 | 44 |
| ICL | 65 | 70 | 56 | 67 |

Gemini 2.0 Flash succeeds on average 27% of the time, although it can be as high as 54% for easier tasks. Gemini Robotics-ER, performs almost twice as well as 2.0 Flash, successfully completing 53% of the tasks on average.

**Few-shot control via in-context examples:**

The previous results demonstrated how Gemini Robotics-ER can be effectively used to tackle a series of tasks entirely zero-shot. However, some dexterous manipulation tasks are beyond Gemini 2.0's current ability to perform zero-shot. Motivated by such cases, we demonstrate that the model can be conditioned on a handful of in-context demonstrations, and can then immediately emulate those behaviors.

Both Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini Robotics-ER are able to effectively use demonstrations entirely in-context to improve performance. Gemini 2.0 Flash's performance reaches 51% in simulation, and Gemini Robotics-ER achieves 65% in both simulation and the real world.

## 3 Robot Actions with Gemini Robotics

In this section, we present Gemini Robotics, a derivative of Gemini that has been fine-tuned to predict robot actions directly. Gemini Robotics is a general-purpose model capable of solving dexterous tasks in different environments and supporting different robot embodiments.

### 3.1 Gemini Robotics: Model and Data

**Model:**

Inference in large VLMs like Gemini Robotics-ER is often slow and requires special hardware. This can cause problems in the context of VLA models, since inference may not be feasible to be run onboard, and the resulting latency may be incompatible with real-time robot control. Gemini Robotics is designed to address these challenges. It consists of two components: a VLA backbone hosted in the cloud (Gemini Robotics backbone) and a local action decoder running on the robot's onboard computer (Gemini Robotics decoder).

The Gemini Robotics backbone is formed by a distilled version of Gemini Robotics-ER and its query-to-response latency has been optimized from seconds to under 160ms. The on-robot Gemini Robotics decoder compensates for the latency of the backbone. When the backbone and local decoder are combined, the end-to-end latency from raw observations to low-level action chunks is approximately 250ms. With multiple actions in the chunk, the effective control frequency is 50Hz.

**Data:**

We collected a large-scale teleoperated robot action dataset on a fleet of ALOHA 2 robots over 12 months, which consists of thousands of hours of real-world expert robot demonstrations. This dataset contains thousands of diverse tasks, covering scenarios with varied manipulation skills, objects, task difficulties, episode horizons, and dexterity requirements.

The training data further includes non-action data such as web documents, code, multi-modal content (image, audio, video), and embodied reasoning and visual question answering data. This improves the model's ability to understand, reason about, and generalize across many robotic tasks, and requests.

**Baselines:**

We compare Gemini Robotics to two state-of-the-art models:

1. **π₀ re-implement**: Our re-implementation of the open-weights state-of-the-art π₀ VLA model. We train π₀ re-implement on our diverse training mixture and find this model to outperform the public checkpoint released by the authors.

2. **Multi-task diffusion policy**: A model that has been shown to be effective in learning dexterous skills from multi-modal demonstrations. Both baselines were trained to convergence using the same composition of our diverse data mixture.

### 3.2 Gemini Robotics can solve diverse dexterous manipulation tasks out of the box

We evaluate Gemini Robotics on 20 diverse tasks that require varying levels of dexterity. These tasks range from simple pick-and-place operations to complex multi-step manipulations involving articulated objects, cloth handling, and precise insertions.

**Key Results:**

- Gemini Robotics significantly outperforms baselines across all task categories
- Achieves robust performance on tasks requiring fine motor control
- Demonstrates smooth, reactive movements that adapt to environmental variations
- Shows strong generalization to objects and scenarios not seen during training

The model's success stems from three key factors:
1. The capable vision language model with enhanced embodied reasoning
2. The robotics-specific training recipe combining vast robot action data with diverse non-robot data
3. The unique architecture designed for low-latency robotic control

### 3.3 Gemini Robotics can closely follow language instructions

We evaluate Gemini Robotics' ability to follow natural language instructions across 5 different scenes with 25 diverse instructions per scene (125 total instruction-scene combinations). The instructions vary in complexity, specificity, and the types of actions required.

**Key Capabilities:**

1. **Instruction Parsing**: Accurately interprets complex, multi-step instructions
2. **Spatial Understanding**: Follows spatial directives like "put the object to the left of the bowl"
3. **Conditional Logic**: Handles conditional instructions like "if the cup is empty, fill it with water"
4. **Object Attributes**: Responds to instructions referencing object properties like color, size, or material
5. **Action Sequences**: Executes multi-step instructions requiring proper sequencing

**Results:**

Gemini Robotics achieves high success rates across all instruction types, demonstrating its ability to bridge natural language understanding with physical manipulation. The model shows particular strength in:

- Interpreting spatial relationships and relative positioning
- Understanding object attributes and using them for task execution
- Managing temporal sequences in multi-step instructions
- Adapting to instruction variations and synonyms

### 3.4 Gemini Robotics brings Gemini's generalization to the physical world

We extensively evaluate Gemini Robotics' generalization capabilities across three axes:

1. **Visual Generalization**: Robustness to changes in lighting, backgrounds, and novel objects
2. **Instruction Generalization**: Ability to handle instruction variations, typos, and different languages
3. **Action Generalization**: Adaptation to new object positions and different instances of target objects

**Evaluation Setup:**

We test generalization using 9 different tasks across multiple scenes, with systematic variations:

- **Visual variations**: Novel distractor objects, background changes, lighting conditions
- **Instruction variations**: Typos, Spanish translations, rephrasing, descriptive modifiers
- **Action variations**: Out-of-distribution object positions, different object instances

**Key Results:**

- Gemini Robotics consistently outperforms baselines across all generalization scenarios
- Shows remarkable robustness to visual variations that would challenge traditional robotics systems
- Maintains performance even with significant instruction modifications
- Adapts well to new object positions and instances, demonstrating spatial reasoning transfer

**Notable Achievements:**

- **Language Robustness**: Successfully executes tasks given instructions in Spanish, despite being primarily trained on English
- **Visual Robustness**: Maintains performance with novel backgrounds and lighting conditions
- **Object Generalization**: Adapts to different sizes, colors, and shapes of target objects
- **Position Invariance**: Handles objects placed in novel locations not seen during training

This generalization capability stems from Gemini Robotics inheriting the strong reasoning and understanding capabilities of the underlying Gemini foundation model, which were developed through training on diverse internet-scale data.

## 4 Specializing and Adapting Gemini Robotics for Dexterity, Reasoning, and New Embodiments

In this section, we demonstrate how Gemini Robotics can be further specialized through additional fine-tuning to achieve capabilities beyond what is possible with the base model. We explore four key areas of specialization:

### 4.1 Long-horizon dexterity

We demonstrate Gemini Robotics' ability to solve complex, long-horizon tasks requiring high dexterity through specialization training. These tasks represent some of the most challenging manipulation problems in robotics.

**Tasks Evaluated:**

1. **Origami Fox Folding**: Multi-step paper folding requiring precise manipulation and understanding of fold sequences
2. **Lunch Box Packing**: Complex task involving multiple objects, containers, and sequential packing operations
3. **Spelling Board Game**: Interactive game requiring card manipulation, spatial reasoning, and game rule understanding
4. **Card Game Playing**: Drawing cards, playing them according to rules, and managing hand state
5. **Snap Peas to Salad**: Using tongs to transfer delicate objects without damage
6. **Nuts to Salad**: Scooping and transferring granular materials with appropriate tools

**Key Results:**

After specialization training, Gemini Robotics achieves significant success rates on these challenging tasks:

- **Origami Fox**: Demonstrates multi-step folding with precise finger control
- **Lunch Box Packing**: Successfully manages complex multi-object assembly tasks
- **Game Playing**: Shows understanding of game rules and appropriate action selection
- **Food Manipulation**: Handles delicate objects and tools with appropriate force control

**Comparison with Baselines:**

Gemini Robotics consistently outperforms both π₀ re-implement and multi-task diffusion baselines across all long-horizon dexterous tasks. The performance gap is particularly pronounced for tasks requiring:

- Fine motor control and precision
- Multi-step reasoning and planning
- Understanding of task constraints and rules
- Coordination between perception and action over extended horizons

### 4.2 Enhanced reasoning and generalization

We further enhance Gemini Robotics' reasoning capabilities through specialized training that improves performance on tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning, semantic understanding, and generalization to novel scenarios.

**Evaluation Categories:**

1. **One-step Reasoning Tasks**: Tasks requiring inference about object properties or relationships
   - "Put the coke can into the same colored plate"
   - "Sort the bottom right mouse into the matching pile"
   - "I need to brush my teeth, pick up the correct item"

2. **Semantic Generalization Tasks**: Tasks requiring understanding of novel semantic concepts
   - "Put the Japanese fish delicacy in the lunch-box" (identifying sushi)
   - "Pick up the full bowl" (distinguishing filled vs. empty containers)

3. **Spatial Understanding Tasks**: Tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning
   - "Pack the smallest coke soda in the lunch-box"
   - "Put the cold medicine in the bottom/top left bowl"

**Key Improvements:**

The reasoning-enhanced version of Gemini Robotics shows substantial improvements over the vanilla model:

- **Inference Capability**: Better at inferring object properties and relationships from context
- **Semantic Understanding**: Improved ability to understand novel concepts and descriptions
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Enhanced understanding of relative spatial relationships and size comparisons
- **Generalization**: Better transfer to scenarios with novel language or spatial configurations

**Performance Analysis:**

Across 100 trials on 8 different reasoning tasks, the enhanced model demonstrates:

- Consistent improvements in success rates across all task categories
- Particularly strong performance on spatial understanding tasks
- Robust handling of novel semantic concepts not seen during initial training
- Maintained performance on standard manipulation tasks while gaining reasoning capabilities

### 4.3 Fast adaptation to new tasks

We evaluate Gemini Robotics' ability to quickly adapt to entirely new tasks using minimal demonstration data. This capability is crucial for practical deployment where robots need to learn new skills efficiently.

**Experimental Setup:**

We test adaptation using 8 distinct manipulation tasks, each representing a component of the longer-horizon tasks from Section 4.1:

1. **Draw Card**: Operating a card dispenser mechanism
2. **Play Card**: Placing cards according to game rules
3. **Pour Lettuce**: Controlled pouring of salad ingredients
4. **Salad Dressing**: Squeezing bottles for precise dispensing
5. **Seal Container**: Multi-point lid closing with proper alignment
6. **Put Container in Lunch-box**: Careful placement in constrained spaces
7. **Zip Lunch-box**: Operating zipper mechanisms
8. **Origami First Fold**: Precise paper manipulation

**Adaptation Protocol:**

For each task, we evaluate performance with increasing amounts of demonstration data:
- **5 demonstrations**: Minimal learning scenario
- **20 demonstrations**: Moderate learning scenario  
- **100 demonstrations**: Rich learning scenario

**Key Results:**

Gemini Robotics demonstrates remarkable adaptation capabilities:

- **Fast Learning**: Achieves reasonable performance with just 5-20 demonstrations
- **Efficient Scaling**: Performance improves consistently with additional demonstrations
- **Task Diversity**: Successfully adapts across mechanically diverse tasks
- **Baseline Comparison**: Significantly outperforms π₀ and diffusion policy baselines

**Notable Achievements:**

- **Sample Efficiency**: Often achieves 60-80% success rates with only 20 demonstrations
- **Skill Transfer**: Leverages pre-existing capabilities to bootstrap learning of new tasks
- **Robustness**: Maintains performance across different initial conditions and object variations
- **Speed**: Adaptation training completes in hours rather than days or weeks

This rapid adaptation capability makes Gemini Robotics practical for real-world deployment where new tasks regularly arise and extensive data collection for each task is impractical.

### 4.4 Adaptation to new embodiments

We demonstrate Gemini Robotics' ability to adapt to completely different robot platforms, moving beyond the ALOHA 2 system used for initial training. This capability is crucial for the practical deployment of foundation models across diverse robotic systems.

**Target Platform:**

We adapt Gemini Robotics to a **bi-arm Franka research platform**, which differs significantly from ALOHA 2 in:

- **Kinematics**: Different arm lengths, joint ranges, and workspace constraints
- **End-effectors**: Different gripper designs and capabilities
- **Control Interface**: Different action spaces and control frequencies
- **Sensing**: Different camera configurations and viewpoints

**Evaluation Tasks:**

We test the adapted model on 4 challenging industrial-relevant tasks:

1. **Tape Hanging on Workshop Wall**: Requires handover between arms and precise placement
2. **Plug Insertion into Socket**: Demands precise alignment and force control with stabilization
3. **Round Belt Assembly (NIST ATB)**: Complex manipulation of flexible materials requiring coordination
4. **Timing Belt Assembly (NIST ATB)**: High-force manipulation (40N) with precise timing and positioning

**Adaptation Process:**

The adaptation involves:
- **Data Collection**: Gathering demonstrations on the new platform
- **Domain Adaptation**: Fine-tuning the model for the new embodiment
- **Action Space Mapping**: Translating between different control interfaces
- **Workspace Calibration**: Adapting to new kinematic constraints

**Key Results:**

**In-Distribution Performance:**

| Task | Success Rate | Progress Score |

**Generalization Performance:**

The adapted model maintains strong generalization capabilities:

- **Visual Variations**: Robust to changes in lighting, backgrounds, and distractor objects
- **Object Variations**: Adapts to different instances of tools and materials
- **Position Variations**: Handles objects placed in novel locations

**Comparison with Baselines:**

Gemini Robotics significantly outperforms single-task diffusion policy baselines:
- **Higher Success Rates**: 2-3x improvement on most tasks
- **Better Generalization**: More robust to visual and positional variations
- **Faster Adaptation**: Requires less demonstration data to achieve good performance

**Key Insights:**

1. **Transfer Learning**: The strong foundation from ALOHA 2 training enables rapid adaptation to new embodiments
2. **Generalization**: The model's understanding of manipulation principles transfers across platforms
3. **Scalability**: The adaptation process is efficient and doesn't require extensive re-training
4. **Robustness**: Performance remains stable across variations in the new environment

This cross-embodiment adaptation capability demonstrates the potential for Gemini Robotics to serve as a true foundation model for robotics, capable of deployment across diverse hardware platforms with minimal additional effort.

## 5 Responsible Development and Safety

We have developed the models introduced in this report in alignment with Google AI Principles and previous releases of AI technology. Ensuring AI is built and used responsibly is an iterative process — this applies to robot foundation models as it does to models for text or images. The hybrid digital-physical and embodied nature of our models, and the fact that they ultimately enable robots to act in the physical world, requires some special consideration.

With guidance from the Responsibility and Safety Council (RSC) and the Responsible Development and Innovation (ReDI) team at Google DeepMind, we identified risks of using our models, and developed safety mitigation frameworks to cover embodied reasoning and action output modalities of our models.

### Traditional Robot Safety

Traditional robot safety is a vast multifaceted discipline ranging from hazard mitigation codified in hundreds of pages of ISO and RIA standards, to collision-free motion planning, force modulation and robust control. Historically, the focus has been on physical action safety, i.e., on ensuring that robots respect hard physical constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance, workspace bounds), have stable mobility (e.g., for locomotion), and can regulate contact forces to be within safe limits.

This falls in the domain of classical constrained control, and is implemented in the lowest levels of the control stack, via methodologies like motion planning, model predictive control, and compliant/force control. Depending on the hardware specifics and environmental constraints, we need VLA models such as Gemini Robotics to be interfaced with such safety-critical lower-level controllers.

### Content Safety

Gemini Safety policies are designed for content safety, preventing Gemini-derived models from generating harmful conversational content such as hate speech, sexual explicitness, improper medical advice, and revealing personally identifiable information. By building on Gemini checkpoints, our robotics models inherit safety training for these policies, promoting safe human-robot dialog.

As our Embodied Reasoning model introduces new output modalities such as pointing, we need additional layers of content safety for these new features. We therefore perform supervised fine-tuning on both Gemini 2.0 and Gemini Robotics-ER with the goal of teaching Gemini when it would be inappropriate to apply generalizations beyond what was available in the image. This training results in a 96% rejection rate for bias-inducing pointing queries, compared to a baseline rate of 20%.

### Semantic Action Safety

Beyond content safety, an important consideration for a general purpose robot is semantic action safety, i.e., the need to respect physical safety constraints in open-domain unstructured environments. These are hard to exhaustively enumerate – that a soft toy must not be placed on a hot stove; an allergic person must not be served peanuts; a wine glass must be transferred in upright orientation; a knife should not be pointed at a human; and so on.

**ASIMOV Datasets:**

Concurrent with this tech report, we develop and release the ASIMOV-datasets to evaluate and improve semantic action safety. This data comprises of visual and text-only safety questioning answering instances. Gemini Robotics-ER models are post-trained on such instances.

**Safety Evaluation Results:**

Our safety evaluations show that both Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini Robotics-ER models perform similarly, demonstrating strong semantic understanding of physical safety in visual scenes and scenarios drawn from real-world injury reports respectively. We see performance improvements with the use of constitutional AI methods.

**Key Safety Metrics:**

- **ASIMOV-Multimodal**: Binary classification accuracy on visual safety scenarios
- **ASIMOV-Injury**: Performance on physical injury prevention scenarios
- **Constitutional AI**: Improved safety alignment through constitution-based training

**Safety Mitigations:**

1. **Multi-layered Safety**: Combining content safety, semantic safety, and traditional robotic safety
2. **Constitutional Training**: Using AI-generated safety principles to guide model behavior
3. **Adversarial Testing**: Evaluating model responses under adversarial prompting conditions
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing assessment of safety performance in deployment

### Societal Impact Considerations

These investigations provide some initial assurances that the rigorous safety standards that are upheld by our non-robotics models also apply to our new class of embodied and robotics-focused models. We will continue to improve and innovate on approaches for safety and alignment as we further develop our family of robot foundation models.

Alongside the potential safety risks, we must also acknowledge the societal impacts of robotics deployments. We believe that proactive monitoring and management of these impacts, including benefits and challenges, is crucial for risk mitigation, responsible deployment and transparent reporting.

## 6 Discussion

In this work we have studied how the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.0 can be brought into the physical world through robotics. Robust human-level embodied reasoning is critical for robots and other physically grounded agents. In recognition of this, we have introduced Gemini Robotics-ER, an embodied VLM that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in spatial understanding, trajectory prediction, multi-view correspondence, and precise pointing.

We have validated Gemini Robotics-ER's strong performance with a new open-sourced benchmark. The results demonstrate that our training procedure is very effective in amplifying Gemini 2.0's inherent multimodal capabilities for embodied reasoning. The resulting model provides a solid foundation for real-world robotics applications, enabling efficient zero-shot and few-shot adaptation for tasks like perception, planning, and code generation for controlling robots.

We have also presented Gemini Robotics, a generalist Vision-Language-Action Model that builds on the foundations of Gemini Robotics-ER and bridges the gap between passive perception and active embodied interaction. As our most dexterous generalist model to date, Gemini Robotics achieves remarkable proficiency in diverse manipulation tasks, from intricate cloth manipulation to precise handling of articulated objects.

We speculate that the success of our method can be attributed to:
1. The capable vision language model with enhanced embodied reasoning
2. Our robotics-specific training recipe, which combines a vast dataset of robot action data with diverse non-robot data
3. Its unique architecture designed for low-latency robotic control

Crucially, Gemini Robotics follows open vocabulary instructions effectively and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, demonstrating its ability to leverage the embodied reasoning capabilities of Gemini Robotics-ER. Finally, we have demonstrated optional fine-tuning for specialization and adaptation that enable Gemini Robotics to adapt to new tasks and embodiments, achieve extreme dexterity, and generalize in challenging scenarios, thus highlighting the flexibility and practicality of our approach in rapidly translating foundational capabilities to real-world applications.

### Limitations and Future Work

Gemini 2.0 and Gemini Robotics-ER have made significant progress in embodied reasoning, but there is still room for improvements for its capabilities. For example, Gemini 2.0 may struggle with grounding spatial relationships across long videos, and its numerical predictions (e.g., points and boxes) may not be precise enough for more fine-grained robot control tasks.

In addition, while our initial results with Gemini Robotics demonstrate promising generalization capabilities, future work will focus on several key areas:

1. **Enhanced Reasoning and Execution**: We aim to enhance Gemini Robotics's ability to handle complex scenarios requiring both multi-step reasoning and precise dexterous movements, particularly in novel situations.

2. **Simulation Integration**: We plan to lean more on simulation to generate visually diverse and contact rich data as well as developing techniques for using this data to build more capable VLA models that can transfer to the real world.

3. **Cross-Embodiment Transfer**: We will expand our multi-embodiment experiments, aiming to reduce the data needed to adapt to new robot types and ultimately achieve zero-shot cross-embodiment transfer.

### Impact and Future Vision

Our work represents a substantial step towards realizing the vision of general-purpose autonomous AI in the physical world. This will bring a paradigm shift in the way that robotics systems can understand, learn and be instructed. While traditional robotics systems are built for specific tasks, Gemini Robotics provides robots with a general understanding of how the world works, enabling them to adapt to a wide range of tasks.

The multimodal, generalized nature of Gemini further has the potential to lower the technical barrier to be able to use and benefit from robotics. In the future, this may radically change what applications robotic systems are used for and by whom, ultimately enabling the deployment of intelligent robots in our daily life.

As such, and as the technology matures, capable robotics models like Gemini Robotics will have enormous potential to impact society for the better. But it will also be important to consider their safety and wider societal implications. Gemini Robotics has been designed with safety in mind and we have discussed several mitigation strategies. In the future we will continue to strive to ensure that the potential of these technologies will be harnessed safely and responsibly.
