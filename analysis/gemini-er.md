# Analysis of Gemini Robotics-ER Model

This document answers specific questions about the Gemini Robotics-ER model based on the paper "Gemini Robotics: Bringing AI into the Physical World" (arXiv:2503.20020v1).

### Is the Gemini Robotics-ER model available for online public testing?

The paper does not state that the Gemini Robotics-ER model is available for public online testing. It is presented as a research model developed by Google DeepMind. While the paper mentions that the ERQA benchmark for evaluating such models is open-source, it provides no information about public access to the model itself.

### What does it take to train this model?

The training of the Gemini Robotics-ER model is a significant undertaking:

*   **Base Model:** It starts as a version of the Gemini 2.0 Flash model, which is then enhanced.
*   **Training Data:** The model is trained on a massive and diverse dataset that includes:
    *   General web documents and code.
    *   Multimodal content (images, audio, video).
    *   Specialized data for embodied reasoning and visual question answering (VQA).
*   **Hardware:** The training requires specialized hardware, specifically Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), versions v4, v5p, and v6e.
*   **Software:** The model is implemented using the JAX and ML Pathways frameworks.

### Are there any other public models that can work this way?

Yes, the paper benchmarks Gemini Robotics-ER against other publicly available large multimodal models that possess similar, though less advanced, embodied reasoning capabilities. These include:

*   **OpenAI's GPT-4o:** Compared on the ERQA, RealworldQA, and BLINK benchmarks.
*   **Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** Also compared on the same benchmarks.

The paper also compares its performance on specific tasks against other models like `Molmo`, `ImVoxelNet`, `Implicit3D`, and `Total3DU`, but the public availability of these specialized models is not explicitly mentioned in the document.
