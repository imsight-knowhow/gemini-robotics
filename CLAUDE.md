# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a learning and research project focused on surveying Google's Gemini Robotics technologies. The repository is currently in its initial stages and serves as a knowledge base for understanding:

- Embodied reasoning models (Gemini Robotics-ER)
- On-device AI capabilities (Gemini Robotics On-Device)
- Developer tools and SDKs for robotics applications
- Complex task learning for robotic systems
- Safety considerations in AI-powered robotics

## Repository Structure

This is a documentation-focused repository with minimal code structure. The main content is organized around research and documentation of Gemini Robotics concepts rather than active development.

### Context Directory

The `context/` directory serves as a centralized knowledge base following standardized organization:

- `context/design/` - Technical specifications and architecture diagrams
- `context/hints/` - Research methodologies and development guides  
- `context/logs/` - Research session records and findings
- `context/plans/` - Implementation roadmaps and research strategies
- `context/refcode/` - Reference implementations and code examples
- `context/summaries/` - Knowledge base documents and concept explanations
- `context/tasks/` - Current and planned research work items
- `context/tools/` - Development utilities and analysis scripts

Always check the context directory for existing knowledge before starting new research tasks.

## Development Notes

- This is primarily a research and documentation repository
- No build tools, test frameworks, or development dependencies are currently configured
- Content focuses on educational exploration of Gemini Robotics technologies
- The project is not affiliated with Google or DeepMind
